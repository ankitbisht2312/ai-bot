## üìä **Premium Factors Across Policies**

Premiums vary based on factors such as age, location, lifestyle, policy term, sum insured, vehicle type, and property risk.

Vehicles in accident-prone zones or older properties in flood-prone areas incur higher premiums. Health insurance for older adults is significantly more expensive due to higher claim probability.
